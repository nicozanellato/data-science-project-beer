# Craft Beer data for the People!
This is my first data science project, scraping data about craft beers and applying machine learning.

Being a craft beer lover I started using the app Untappd that allows you to rate and share the beers you’re drinking with your mates and see interesting breweries, new beers and events. As it is an app used all over the world, breweries and pubs list their beers on it and people can rate them. 
I also found the app very useful for when I am travelling. It highlights local breweries or pubs and their beer listing on the map, so that you can find and drink some local goodness. 

I thought it would be amazing if I could get some of their data and to create some data visualisation and apply machine learning on it! Also, I wanted to work on something that I loved and stem away from the box standard datasets such as Iris. There is nothing wrong with the Iris dataset, it’s a great way to start, but I wanted to do something a bit more original and creative.

Untppd has also a website, so I decided to give web scraping a go, by scraping all the top 50 breweries and their beer listings for every country. I managed to scrape about 40k different beers from all over the world!

After scraping the website, I have created an interactive visualisation in Tableau and uploaded it on my Tableau Public profile, which can be seen here (https://public.tableau.com/views/Beer_Project/Map2?:embed=y&:display_count=yes).

I have applied K-nearest neighbours to the the dataset to predict the beer rating of a new beer, given the brewery, ABV (alcohol content), IBU (International Bitterness Unit) and beer type. I managed to reach an accuracy score of 88%! Not too bad really! 

Feedbacks are welcome! Please let me know what you think or what can be improved.
